In order to run the code,
Clone the repo and run-

npm install //for installing the dependencies

npm start //for running the server

npm test //for running the test scripts

Also, note that I have created a sample database and hosted it online..
The code will run on this particular database even on local machine unless the configurations are changed in code.
